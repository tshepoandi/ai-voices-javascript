Project Overview
This Node.js backend application integrates with the ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API, providing endpoints for listing available voices and generating audio from text using specified voices. The generated speech is saved as an audio file, allowing flexible use for different text-to-speech needs.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14.x or higher)
ElevenLabs API Key
Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd elevenlabs
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project root.
Add your ElevenLabs API key:
bash
Copy code
ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Start the server:

API Endpoints
GET /api/voices
Description: Retrieves a list of available voices from the ElevenLabs API.
Response: JSON array of voice objects.
Example Response:
json
Copy code
[
{
"voice_id": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",
"name": "Rachel",
"description": "Default female voice",
"labels": ["Female", "Default"]
}
]
POST /api/text-to-speech
Description: Converts provided text to speech using the specified voice and saves the audio file at the given location.
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
"text": "Hello, welcome to ElevenLabs text-to-speech API!",
"voiceId": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",
"outputPath": "./output/sample.mp3"
}
Response: JSON object confirming successful audio generation:
json
Copy code
{
"message": "Audio stream saved successfully to ./output/sample.mp3"
}
Usage Examples
Listing Available Voices
Use curl to retrieve available voices:

bash
Copy code
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/voices
Generating Speech from Text
Convert text to speech using a specified voice:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/text-to-speech \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
"text": "Hello, this is a sample TTS request",
"voiceId": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",
"outputPath": "./output/sample.mp3"
}'
Troubleshooting
Invalid API Key: Ensure that your ElevenLabs API key is correctly set in the .env file.
File Write Errors: Ensure that the output directory exists and is writable. Adjust directory permissions if needed.
Invalid Voice ID: Check that the voiceId used in your request matches a valid voice from your ElevenLabs account.
To view detailed errors, monitor the server console output.

Future Improvements
Frontend Interface: Build a user-friendly frontend for easier interaction with the API.
Authentication: Add user authentication to secure API endpoints.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent API overuse.
Caching: Add caching for frequently used voices or repeated text to speech requests.
Batch Processing: Extend support to process multiple text-to-speech requests at once for efficiency.
